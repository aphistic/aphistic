## Hey! I'm Kristin!

I love coding and learning/experiencing new things! I'm a huge geek, nerd, 👩‍💻, etc and love
everything about it! I'm most interested in moving bits around at the lowest levels, whether
they're over networks or a system bus.

### About me:

- 💜 Favorite languages: Rust, Go, C#, Python
- 💻 Exciting tech: Kubernetes, RISC-V, FPGAs, WASM

- 💬 Ask me about: Anything! I love mentoring people 👩‍🏫, especially when it's a topic I'm
  passionate about (though I am a total introvert so sometimes I need some down time). Please contact me if you have questions about anything I might be able to help with!
